# 🏁🧩 Genetic Algorithm Maze Solver

Welcome to the **Genetic Algorithm Maze Solver**! 🚀 This project leverages the power of **genetic algorithms** to navigate and solve mazes efficiently. Inspired by **natural selection**, our AI evolves over generations to find the optimal path! 🧬

## 🌟 Key Features
- 🧠 **AI-Powered Maze Solving** – Uses **genetic algorithms** to learn the best route.
- 🔄 **Evolution in Action** – Selection, crossover, and mutation for continuous improvement.
- 📊 **Visualization** – Watch as the solver adapts and conquers mazes in real-time.

## 🧬 How It Works
### 1️⃣ Initialization
- The algorithm starts with a **population** of randomly generated paths.
- Each path consists of a **sequence of moves** (up, down, left, right).

### 2️⃣ Fitness Evaluation
- Paths are evaluated based on their **distance to the goal**.
- Shorter, more direct paths receive **higher fitness scores**.

### 3️⃣ Selection
- The top-performing paths are **selected as parents** for the next generation.
- **Elitism** ensures the best paths survive.

### 4️⃣ Crossover
- **New paths** are created by **combining segments** of parent paths.
- This mimics **genetic recombination** in nature.

### 5️⃣ Mutation
- Random **small changes** are introduced in the offspring paths.
- This helps maintain **genetic diversity** and prevents stagnation.

### 6️⃣ Repeat Until Optimal Solution
- The process repeats for multiple **generations**, refining solutions over time.
